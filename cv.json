        "I am the rock solid professional for the times you need to get things done. Wide knowledge in everything IT, including managing teams. I am perfectly comfortable working with company management to fulfill business goals, while ensuring every team member has meaningful things to do, and that the team excels as a whole.",
        "I also enjoy learning and doing the necessary things myself when there is a need for it. This has led me to have the ability to fill multiple roles in an organization, and to understand a wide variety of technologies. When necessary I can build the product from scratch, from installing the servers, to building the backend, frontend, and continuous delivery systems, as well as all the integrations and tools necessary to support operating it.",
        "I enjoy mostly working at a free pace, where I don't need to worry about working hours or days, but focus on the results and getting things done. However, I have been in many stressful situations over the year and excel at times of urgent need. I can put the necessary time into solving any problem I'm facing, no matter how obscure and frustrating. When I get the time to think of a problem properly I can frequently come up with creative new suggestions on how to get the necessary results.",
        "I take pride in my ability to choose the right tool for the job, deciding when a homegrown solution is needed and when a 3rd party solution is much more cost effective. I don't choose technologies just because I have a history with them, or because \"everyone uses them\", I choose technologies because they are perfect for the job."

        "I have done everything from budgeting, government grant applications, managing product backlog, hiring talented team members, to building product prototypes. I am a big fan of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and DevOps practices in general."

I've managed the backlog of tasks based on improvement ideas, ensuring all stakeholders know the priorities and when the changes are expected.</p><p>I've put heavy focus on automating tasks that otherwise would require manual work, thus optimizing the performance of both the engineering and operations teams of the company. Engineering spends less time on e.g. releases and manual testing, while operations can spend more time on planning for the future as tasks such as importing product data and handling of orders has been largely automated.</p><p>During a pivot I stepped down from actively working to advising via my board position.</p>"
